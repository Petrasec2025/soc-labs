# Practical Task

## Task: Analyze a Suspicious IP

I investigated the IP address `221.181.182.150` using:
- [AbuseIPDB](https://abuseipdb.com)
- [Cisco Talos Intelligence](https://talosintelligence.com)

### Workflow
1. Alert generated in the SIEM.
2. Verified the IP using threat intelligence sources.
3. Confirmed it as malicious.
4. Escalated the alert and added a firewall rule to block the IP.
