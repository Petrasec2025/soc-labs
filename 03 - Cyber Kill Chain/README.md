# Lab 03: Cyber Kill Chain

## Overview
In this lab, I explored the **Cyber Kill Chain**, a 7-phase attack model developed by **Lockheed Martin** to better understand how adversaries compromise systems and accomplish their objectives.

By studying each stage, I learned how attackers operate and how to detect, prevent, and break the chain to stop multi-stage cyber attacks.

## Learning Objectives
- Break down each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain
- Map real-world breaches to the Kill Chain model
- Learn the tools and tactics used by attackers
- Identify how to mitigate threats at every stage

## Outcome
I gained hands-on experience simulating and analyzing a full cyber attack lifecycle and learned how to think like an adversary to better defend networks.
